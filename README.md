# Quantile-Regression
We learn the basics of quantile regression and explore scenarios where it is useful. We learn how to construct confidence intervals akin to linear regression. Finally, we learn how to implement it in R.

The codework is present in `Quantile-Regression.R`. An analysis of the models are providied in `Quantile-Regression.Rmd`. A comprehensive literature review is provided in `ProjectReportWithCode.pdf`.
